## Contributions

Adrien Bartoli originates the idea of scanline-homography along with its estimation by B-Spline and polynomial paramterizations.
Fang Bai develops the theory of fundamental homography equation, the QR form to parameterize plane-homographies, and the alternation method for pose estimation.
Agniva Sengupta makes substantial contributions on the experiment part in the initial submission.
The article is written by Fang Bai.
