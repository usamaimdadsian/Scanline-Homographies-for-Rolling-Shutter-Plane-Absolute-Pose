function A = dlt(x,y,dim)
% A = DLT(x,y) solves for the projective transformation matrix A with respect to
% the linear system y ~ Ax where ~ denotes equality up to a scale, using the
% Direct Linear Transformation technique. A is a m-by-n matrix, x is a n-by-k
% matrix that contains k source points in column vector form and y is a m-by-k
% matrix containning k target points in column vector form. The solution is
% normalised as any multiple of A also satisfies the equation.
%
% A = dlt(x,y,dim) further specifies the vanishing dimension 0 < dim <= m, by
% which the remaining rows in y are divided. By default dim is set to m, the
% last row of y. The vanashing dimension has to be chosen carefully to avoid
% the singularity of division by zero.
%
% Example:
%
%   A = rand(3,4);
%   x = rand(4,12);
%   A = A / norm(A);
%   A - dlt(x,A*x) % should be a small number
